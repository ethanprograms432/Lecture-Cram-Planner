## Lecture-Cram-Planner-v1.0

A program designed to help you catch up on lectures that you are currently behind on by generating a timetable showing you how you can catch up with your current schedule as well as an estimation of how long it will take if you begin on Monday of that week.

## Notes

This program was made during my first year of university. Instead of making this version better, I began working on a new version
with the use of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## How to use

1. Pull the code onto your local machine, and run LectureCramPlanner.java
2. An Instructions panel is present on the home page when run that will tell you how to use the program
